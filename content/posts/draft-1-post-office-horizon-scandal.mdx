I recently learnt about the British Post Office Horizon Scandal where more than 900 sub-postmasters (self-employed operators of post office branches) were wrongly prosecuted for theft and fraud between 1999 and 2015. 

It was later determined that shortfalls reported in the accounting software were caused by bugs which were actively covered up by the Post Office and Fujitsu. This act lead to wrongful convictions, imprisonment and a heavy emotional toll on families that in some cases contributed to the suicide of sub-postmasters.

The story shared similarities with Australia's own Robodebt scandal and whilst they are both systemic failures of the government and big corporations, it's still an opportunity to understand the root cause of these software bugs.

At a previous employer I was scrutinised by a director for building a retry mechanism for a customer onboarding process. The customer onboarding in it's current state was a complicated set of steps. An orchestration of activities across different microservices that comunicated out to 3rd party systems. In a situation probably not disimilar to how the Horizon software was built, shortcuts were taken and the process was built with zero fault tolerance. It assumed that everything would work 100% of the time and if anything did go wrong, well, good luck to you!

Luckily, the team made the executive decision to proceed with building the retry mechanism. The retry mechanism had a significant impact on customer signups and saved hours of manual reconciliation that would have taken place due to faults of hours and would have saved really can't imagine what would have happened, it would have saved massive amounts of time manually reconciling data and potentially lost customers.





 
A lack of fault tolerance in the system, amongst other problems caused inconsistencies which were then blamed on sub-postmasters.  The worst part is that even when the Post Office knew about the software issues they continued to prosecute the sub-postmasters which resulted in wrongful convictions, imprisonment, and a heavy toll on families including 4 cases of suicide.
The story shares similarities with Australia’s own Robodebt scandal. Whilst they are horrible situations for those involved, for others it presents itself as a learning opportunity.
Acknowledging there are likely larger systemic problems with what happened than just software that wasn't built correctly.
As a software engineer, these are my takeaways:
a) Managing consistency in distributed systems is complex
b) Fault tolerance is a “MUST have” and part of what defines the quality of a system. All systems eventually fail.
Disgruntled customers
Wasted time and money on your business, support and devs working out why 1 ≠ 1

At worst everything could grind to a hault and have a significant, negative impact on your customers.
Generally speaking, stakeholders don't know/care about fail tolerance until things stop working.
c) Software systems are not 100% accurate, reliable, precise. They are built by humans after all
d) Software teams have a responsibility to consider the impact (positive and negative) to users. For example, the logs produced by the Horizon system were flawed. It was found to produce misrepresentations of when, what and who had performed a particular action, which was then used to prosecute sub-postmasters.
